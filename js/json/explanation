sometimes we receive a raw JSON string, and we need to convert it to an object ourselves. And when we want to send a JavaScript object across the network, we need to convert it to JSON (a string) before sending it. Luckily, these two problems are so common in web development that a built-in JSON object is available in browsers, which contains the following two methods:

parse(): Accepts a JSON string as a parameter, and returns the corresponding JavaScript object.
stringify(): Accepts an object as a parameter, and returns the equivalent JSON string.
