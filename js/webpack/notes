Bundling
In the ES6 modules lesson, we learned what an entry point is, what a dependency graph is, and how to add an entry point file to HTML as a module script. With bundling, the same concepts of entry points and dependency graphs apply: we provide the bundler with an entry point. It then builds a dependency graph from that file, combines all relevant files together, and then outputs a single file with all the necessary code included.

While it does this, we could also get it to do a whole bunch of other things, such as minifying our code, image optimizations, or even “tree shaking”. Most of these extra optimizations are out of the scope of this course; we will instead be focusing on basic bundling of JavaScript, and handling HTML, CSS, and images.
